This Experience Upload Agreement ("Agreement") is made between the organization or individual uploading content ("You" or the "Creator") and Reach Infrastructure ("Reach", "we", "us", "the Platform").

By clicking "I Agree" or by uploading, publishing, or otherwise distributing any content package, mods, maps, assets, or materials (collectively, the "Experience") to the Reach Platform, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be legally bound by the terms of this Agreement.

## 1. Your Representations and Warranties (What You Promise Us)
By uploading an Experience, you represent, warrant, and covenant that:

Ownership and Licenses: You are the original owner of all content and assets included in your Experience, or you have obtained all necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions from the original owners to use, reproduce, and distribute such content through our Platform. This includes, but is not limited to, third-party mods, texture packs, music, art, and code.

1.2. Compliance with Third-Party Licenses: If your Experience includes third-party software or assets (e.g., open-source mods from CurseForge or Modrinth), you have fully complied with the terms of all applicable licenses (e.g., MIT, GPL, Apache, etc.). You are solely responsible for any violation of these licenses.

1.3. Compliance with Minecraft EULA: Your Experience, and any monetization method associated with it, complies and will at all times comply with the Minecraft End-User License Agreement (EULA) and all applicable Commercial Usage Guidelines issued by Mojang Studios and/or Microsoft. You acknowledge that failure to comply with these terms may result in action by Mojang/Microsoft, including the blacklisting of servers.

1.4. Non-Infringing Content: Your Experience does not infringe upon any copyright, trademark, trade secret, patent, or other intellectual property right of any third party.

1.5. Appropriate and Safe Content: Your Experience does not contain or promote:
- Malicious code, viruses, spyware, malware, or any other harmful software.
- Content that is unlawful, defamatory, harassing, hateful, pornographic, or otherwise objectionable.
- Content that promotes dangerous activities, gambling, or is otherwise not suitable for all ages.

1.7. You agree at all times, without exception, to add the “Platform” logo to promotional materials or other items advertising the agreed experience.

This license terminates when you remove your Experience from our Platform, though we may retain archival copies for a commercially reasonable period of time.

## 3. Content Moderation and Right of Removal
